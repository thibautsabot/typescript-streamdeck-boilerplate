# Smartthings plugin for StreamDeck

StreamDeck plugin to control your smartthings devices and scenes.

Chose what you need from the list :

Add your smartthings personal access token and get everything from your hub !


## Access token

A personal access token is required to fetch "smart things" from your hub.

Head over to https://account.smartthings.com/tokens and connect to your Samsung / Smartthings account.

Click on "GENERATE NEW TOKEN".

Enter a name and tick at least "Devices" and "Scenes".

*Your token is only stored on your machine !* It allows the plugin to control your devices, keep it secret. 

## Informations

Made from https://github.com/thibautsabot/typescript-streamdeck-boilerplate/.

For now only Devices and Scene are configured.

You can control any "switch" devices. It theory we can control anything but I don't have the devices to test it out.

You can contribute to the project by opening a Pull Request or an Issue.
